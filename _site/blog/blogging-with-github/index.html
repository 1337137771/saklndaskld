				<h1>Blogging with GitHub</h1>
			</header>

				<p>Owning a part of the web is like owning an island – a sandbox without limits. This blog took a bit of work and was fun to build. So in this post I’ll share the process for doing so.</p>

<!-- more start -->

<p>I began by trying to find the easiest, most flexible way to publish articles. Whatever method would also have to meet the following requirements:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Full content and management capabilities. The ability to control the content and choice of back-end / front-end is invaluable. As a web developer this is a given.</li>
  <li>Easy publishing. This means, no more than three steps from writing to published. <code class="highlighter-rouge">Write &gt; Click Save &gt; Published</code> is ideal.</li>
  <li><a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>. If I was going to do any sort of significant writing it better be done with Markdown – a super-easy-to-use <em>“text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers”</em>.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="full-content--management-capabilities">Full Content &amp; Management Capabilities</h2>

<p>Requirement #1 removes the option of publishing via many popular online services like <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> and <a href="http://www.squarespace.com/">Squarespace</a>. This was a diffcult decision to make, because I’ve spent years curating content on <a href="http://dannygarcia.tumblr.com/">my tumblelog</a>. Regardless, I want to own and control 100% of what I publish.</p>

<p>The easy solution here is to simply publish locally and not give in to the cloud. Generally this is a heck of a lot of work. It usually means purchasing a domain, managing a server, choosing a back-end language, setting up a database &amp; <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr> and building out the front-end as well.</p>

<p>Thankfully, we have <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a> and <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> to make this process easy. By using GH Pages, we can eliminate the back-end completely. This is not only a form of liberation but a key component to managing content. There’s a local copy of everything with the right to redistribute it as I see fit.</p>

<h3 id="managing-content-without-a-cms">Managing Content Without a CMS</h3>

<p>Think of CMS as less of a tool or app and more as a <em>system</em>. Managing content is as simple as it is defined, meaning we are not limited to server-side programs. <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> is an amazing tool for managing static content. It’s geared toward blog-type site structures and is also a flexible templating system. It’s also loaded with many <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/configuration">configuration options</a>. Best of all, GitHub Pages supports it right out of the box.</p>

<p>To make a simple Jekyll site just publish an <code class="highlighter-rouge">index.html</code> file to the remote <code class="highlighter-rouge">gh-pages</code> branch of your project and GitHub will take care of the rest. GitHub also gives us the option of creating a repo that is formated like so <code class="highlighter-rouge">[username].github.com</code>. This tells GitHub that the whole repo is a dedicated Jekyll site and uses the <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code> branch to deploy. You’ll probably want to read the <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/">wiki</a> for more on setting up a Jekyll blog. You can also take a peek at the <a href="https://github.com/dannygarcia/dannygarcia.github.com">source code</a> for this site.</p>

<h3 id="the-front-end">The Front-end</h3>

<p>All front-end developers should have a workflow in place for the development and publication of projects. There are many tools and libraries for maintaining a sane working environment, ranging from <a href="http://incident57.com/codekit/">simple</a> apps to <a href="http://yeoman.io/">complex</a> <abbr title="Command Line Interface">CLI</abbr>s.</p>

<p>I’ve chosen the <a href="https://github.com/ff0000/red-boilerplate">RED Boilerplate</a> (RBP) for this site – not just because I work with the folks that build it but because I’m familiar with its process. The RBP project templates are setup with <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">HTML5 Boilerplate</a>, <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a> and <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a> make compiling CSS a breeze, <a href="https://github.com/ff0000/rosy">Rosy</a> is my AMD framework of choice, and the CLI workflow ties it nicely together with <a href="http://gruntjs.com">grunt.js</a>.</p>

<p>RBP also makes it easy to add grunt tasks. I was able to use its extendability to create a <a href="https://github.com/dannygarcia/grunt-jekyll">grunt plugin and task for Jekyll</a> making development as easy as typing <code class="highlighter-rouge">grunt watch:jekyll</code> in the command line.</p>

<h2 id="easy-publishing">Easy Publishing</h2>

<p>I began by publishing articles with <a href="http://prose.io/">prose.io</a>. But recently, GitHub has added both the ability to edit and publish files in a super cool <a href="https://github.com/blog/1379-zen-writing-mode">Zen Writing Mode</a>. This writing mode is perfect for blogging.</p>

<h2 id="markdown">Markdown</h2>

<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> is great! it makes it easy for me to neatly write HTML. Here’s an image of this article in progress:</p>

<h2 id="progress">Progress</h2>

<p>This process is in progress. Front-end development appeals to me because it changes so constantly and drastically. There is always something new to learn – a level above my own. This makes consistency a bit challenging but I look forward to how this site will evolve.</p>
